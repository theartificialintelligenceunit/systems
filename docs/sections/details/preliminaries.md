    <tr><td>Problem Statement</td><td>What is the problem, and why is it important to solve this problem?<br><br></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Outcome Expectations, Underlying Aims</td>
        <td>What are the potential product's outcome expectations, e.g.,
        <blockquote>
            An increase in the detection of early-stage, i.e. mild, diabetic retinopathy, hence the prevention of sight loss amongst a greater percentage of diabetic patients.
        </blockquote>            
        <br>            
        The underlying aim might be, e.g.,            
        <blockquote>
            To reduce the mis-classification rate of retinal images of diabetic patients to ≤ 1.25% per class per quarter.
        </blockquote><br><br></td>

        <td><b>What is the aim, expected output, of the product's model?</b>  Example:
        <blockquote>
            A retinal image's diabetic retinopathy classification probability per class.
        </blockquote>

        <b>What will the deployed product present to the optician?</b>  Or rather, <b>how will the model's output be used?</b><sup>1</sup>  Considering the example above, the client's opticians might expect:        
        <ul class="disc">
            <li class="disc">The classification probability per class.</li>
            <li class="disc">The definition of each class.</li>
            <li class="disc">The classification; vis-à-vis the highest classification probability.</li>
            <li class="disc">The preliminary treatment pathway of the classification, according to the rules of the optician's institution.</li>
            <li class="disc">The retinal image.</li>
        </ul></td>
