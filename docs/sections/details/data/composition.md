# Composition

In general, the questions herein should be studied before data collection.  The datasheets paper[^datasheets] notes that most of the questions:

<blockquote>
  "… are intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to make informed decisions about using the dataset for their chosen tasks. … the questions are designed to elicit information about compliance with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions."
</blockquote>

<br>
<br>

## What does each data set instance represent?

Describe what each instance, i.e., row, of the data set represents.  Although peculiar, if the data set is multi-representational, e.g., an instance in a merchant's data base table might represent one of: (a) an online reading event, (b) an online product purchasing event, or \(c\) an online download event.  Each representation must be described.

<br>
<br>

## The # of Instances

How many instances does the data set have?

<br>
<br>

## Pre-processed?

Are any aspects of the data set pre-processed?  If yes:

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc">Document the pre-processing steps.</li>
    <li class="disc">State whether the underlying raw data is available, and provide a link to the data.</li>
    <li class="disc">If available, provide a link to the pre-processing programs.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

## Is the data set a sample of a larger data set?

**If yes:**

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc"><b>If the data set is representative</b> of the larger data set: How was representativeness verified/validated?</li>
    <li class="disc"><b>If the data set is not representative</b> of the larger data set, e.g., is a geographically focused subset, explain why.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

## Lineage

Summarise the data set's lineage, including linkage options.[^lineage-qlik]<sup>, </sup>[^lineage-ibm]

<br>
<br>

## Licences & Fees

If applicable, summarise the data's costs.

<br>
<br>

## Profiles of Instances

Herein, the focus is a summary of the instances of a data set, e.g., for a tabular data set:

**By Field**

* The field name.
* Description: What does the element of an instance denote/represent?
* Data type.
* Dictionary of a categorical data type.
* Unit of measure.
* Is this a raw data field or a feature?
* Is this a target field?
* Does the field identify a sub-population?
* Column Profile: Note column profiling <i>"… provides statistical information regarding the distribution of data values and associated patterns that are assigned to each data attribute, …"</i>. [^profiling] &nbsp; &nbsp; If a field/column has missing elements, explain why.
* A graph of the field's data distribution.


<br>

**Across Fields**

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc">Cross-Column Profiles: Relationships between columns.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>


## Errors

Please detail any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies.


<br>
<br>


## Recommended Data Splits for Machine Learning

Are there recommended data splits?

<br>
<br>

## Confidentiality

Does the data set contain data that might be considered confidential?  For example,

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc">Is the data protected by legal privilege or by doctor–patient confidentiality?</li>
    <li class="disc">Does the data include the content of private/non-public communications of individuals.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

## Identification of Individuals

Is it possible to identify individuals directly or indirectly?

<br>
<br>

## Data Sensitivity

Does the data set include sensitive data elements?  Describe.  Examples of sensitive data elements are 
elements that directly/indirectly reveal:

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc">Locations.</li>
    <li class="disc">Financial details.</li>
    <li class="disc">Health details.</li>
    <li class="disc">Biometric profiles.</li>
    <li class="disc">Genetic profiles.</li>
    <li class="disc">Government identification codes of individuals.</li>
    <li class="disc">Criminal history.</li>
    <li class="disc">Institutionally and/or commercially sensitive data.</li>
    <li class="disc">Race or ethnic origin.</li>
    <li class="disc">Sexual orientations.</li>
    <li class="disc">Religious beliefs.</li>
    <li class="disc">Political opinions.</li>
    <li class="disc">Trade union memberships.</li>
    <li class="disc">And more.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

## Distressing/Dangerous Data Elements

Does the dataset contain traumatising, anxiety inducing, weapon development, etc., elements?[^datasheets-acm]<sup>, </sup>[^datasheets]<sup>, </sup>[^time-2022]<sup>, </sup>[^time-2023]
