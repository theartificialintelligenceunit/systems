# Natural Language Processing

This section only applies to data sets for natural language processing (NLP).  The focus being the *proposed data 
statements* of <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.162/tacl_a_00041/43452/Data-Statements-for-Natural-Language-Processing" target="_blank">Data Statements for Natural Language Processing: Toward Mitigating System Bias and Enabling Better Science</a> by E Bender & B Friedman.  

Please study the description of each statement within [Section 5](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.162/tacl_a_00041/43452/Data-Statements-for-Natural-Language-Processing).  Subsequently, and per data set, record the 
applicable data statements, especially in relation to curation rationale[^1], language variety[^2], speaker demographic, annotator demographic, speech situation[^3], text characteristics[^4], recording quality[^5], provenance[^6], and any other pertinent details.

[^1]: Why was the data collected?  In brief, which "… texts were included and what were the goals in selecting texts, both in the original collection and in any further sub-selection?"  Impacts inference.

[^2]: This is important because languages "… differ from each other in structural ways that can interact with NLP algorithms".  Additionally, and within a language, "… regional or social dialects can also show great variation".

[^3]: Mainly because "… characteristics of the speech situation can affect linguistic structure and patterns …".

[^4]: Predominantly because "… genre and topic influence the vocabulary and structural characteristics of texts". The text <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/dimensions-of-register-variation/introduction/61C4A891E99FE22223268914361D2F76" target="_blank">Dimensions of Register Variation: A Cross-Linguistic Comparison</a> might be helpful.

[^5]: If applicable.

[^6]: If the data set was derived from an existing data set "… the data statements for the source datasets should be included as an appendix"
